         The Communist Manifesto







A spectre is haunting Europe -- the spectre of communism. All the powers of 

old Europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this spectre: Pope 

and Tsar, Metternich and Guizot, French Radicals and German police-spies.



Where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by 

its opponents in power? Where is the opposition that has not hurled back the 

branding reproach of communism, against the more advanced opposition 

parties, as well as against its reactionary adversaries?



Two things result from this fact:



     I. Communism is already acknowledged by all European

     powers to be itself a power.



     II. It is high time that Communists should openly, in the face of

     the whole world, publish their views, their aims, their

     tendencies, and meet this nursery tale of the spectre of

     communism with a manifesto of the party itself. 



To this end, Communists of various nationalities have assembled in London 

and sketched the following manifesto, to be published in the English, 

French, German, Italian, Flemish and Danish languages.







                          I



         BOURGEOIS AND PROLETARIANS [1] 







The history of all hitherto existing society [2] is the history of class 

struggles.



Freeman and slave, patrician and plebian, lord and serf, guild-master [3]and 

journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition 

to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a 

fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of 

society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.



In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated 

arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social 

rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebians, slaves; in the 

Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, 

serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.



The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal 

society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new 

classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the 

old ones.



Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct 

feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and 

more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes 

directly facing each other -- bourgeoisie and proletariat.



>From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the 

earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie 

were developed.



The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground 

for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the 

colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means 

of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, 

to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the 

revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.



The feudal system of industry, in which industrial production was 

monopolized by closed guilds, now no longer suffices for the growing wants 

of the new markets. The manufacturing system took its place. The 

guild-masters were pushed aside by the manufacturing middle class; division 

of labor between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of 

division of labor in each single workshop.



Meantime, the markets kept ever growing, the demand ever rising. Even 

manufacturers no longer sufficed. Thereupon, steam and machinery 

revolutionized industrial production. The place of manufacture was taken by 

the giant, MODERN INDUSTRY; the place of the industrial middle class by 

industrial millionaires, the leaders of the whole industrial armies, the 

modern bourgeois.



Modern industry has established the world market, for which the discovery of 

America paved the way. This market has given an immense development to 

commerce, to navigation, to communication by land. This development has, in 

turn, reacted on the extension of industry; and in proportion as industry, 

commerce, navigation, railways extended, in the same proportion the 

bourgeoisie developed, increased its capital, and pushed into the background 

every class handed down from the Middle Ages.



We see, therefore, how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a 

long course of development, of a series of revolutions in the modes of 

production and of exchange.



Each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a 

corresponding political advance in that class. An oppressed class under the 

sway of the feudal nobility, an armed and self-governing association of 

medieval commune [4]: here independent urban republic (as in Italy and 

Germany); there taxable "third estate" of the monarchy (as in France); 

afterward, in the period of manufacturing proper, serving either the 

semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility, 

and, in fact, cornerstone of the great monarchies in general -- the 

bourgeoisie has at last, since the establishment of Modern Industry and of 

the world market, conquered for itself, in the modern representative state, 

exclusive political sway. The executive of the modern state is but a 

committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie.



The bourgeoisie, historically, has played a most revolutionary part.



The bourgeoisie, wherever it has got the upper hand, has put an end to all 

feudal, patriarchal, idyllic relations. It has pitilessly torn asunder the 

motley feudal ties that bound man to his "natural superiors", and has left 

no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 

"cash payment". It has drowned out the most heavenly ecstacies of religious 

fervor, of chivalrous enthusiasm, of philistine sentimentalism, in the icy 

water of egotistical calculation. It has resolved personal worth into 

exchange value, and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered 

freedoms, has set up that single, unconscionable freedom -- Free Trade. In 

one word, for exploitation, veiled by religious and political illusions, it 

has substituted naked, shameless, direct, brutal exploitation.



The bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored 

and looked up to with reverent awe. It has converted the physician, the 

lawyer, the priest, the poet, the man of science, into its paid wage 

laborers.



The bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil, and has 

reduced the family relation into a mere money relation.



The bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of 

vigor in the Middle Ages, which reactionaries so much admire, found its 

fitting complement in the most slothful indolence. It has been the first to 

show what man's activity can bring about. It has accomplished wonders far 

surpassing Egyptian pyramids, Roman aqueducts, and Gothic cathedrals; it has 

conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations 

and crusades. 



The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the 

instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with 

them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of 

production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of 

existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of 

production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting 

uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier 

ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and 

venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones 

become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, 

all that is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with 

sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind.



The need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the 

bourgeoisie over the entire surface of the globe. It must nestle everywhere, 

settle everywhere, establish connections everywhere.



The bourgeoisie has, through its exploitation of the world market, given a 

cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country. To 

the great chagrin of reactionaries, it has drawn from under the feet of 

industry the national ground on which it stood. All old-established national 

industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed. They are 

dislodged by new industries, whose introduction becomes a life and death 

question for all civilized nations, by industries that no longer work up 

indigenous raw material, but raw material drawn from the remotest zones; 

industries whose products are consumed, not only at home, but in every 

quarter of the globe. In place of the old wants, satisfied by the production 

of the country, we find new wants, requiring for their satisfaction the 

products of distant lands and climes. In place of the old local and national 

seclusion and self-sufficiency, we have intercourse in every direction, 

universal inter-dependence of nations. And as in material, so also in 

intellectual production. The intellectual creations of individual nations 

become common property. National one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become 

more and more impossible, and from the numerous national and local 

literatures, there arises a world literature.



The bourgeoisie, by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production, 

by the immensely facilitated means of communication, draws all, even the 

most barbarian, nations into civilization. The cheap prices of commodities 

are the heavy artillery with which it forces the barbarians' intensely 

obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate. It compels all nations, on 

pain of extinction, to adopt the bourgeois mode of production; it compels 

them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst, i.e., to 

become bourgeois themselves. In one word, it creates a world after its own 

image.



The bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns. It has 

created enormous cities, has greatly increased the urban population as 

compared with the rural, and has thus rescued a considerable part of the 

population from the idiocy of rural life. Just as it has made the country 

dependent on the towns, so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian 

countries dependent on the civilized ones, nations of peasants on nations of 

bourgeois, the East on the West.



The bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of 

the population, of the means of production, and of property. It has 

agglomerated population, centralized the means of production, and has 

concentrated property in a few hands. The necessary consequence of this was 

political centralization. Independent, or but loosely connected provinces, 

with separate interests, laws, governments, and systems of taxation, became 

lumped together into one nation, with one government, one code of laws, one 

national class interest, one frontier, and one customs tariff.



The bourgeoisie, during its rule of scarce one hundred years, has created 

more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding 

generations together. Subjection of nature's forces to man, machinery, 

application of chemistry to industry and agriculture, steam navigation, 

railways, electric telegraphs, clearing of whole continents for cultivation, 

canalization or rivers, whole populations conjured out of the ground -- what 

earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces 

slumbered in the lap of social labor?



We see then: the means of production and of exchange, on whose foundation 

the bourgeoisie built itself up, were generated in feudal society. At a 

certain stage in the development of these means of production and of 

exchange, the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged, 

the feudal organization of agriculture and manufacturing industry, in one 

word, the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the 

already developed productive forces; they became so many fetters. They had 

to be burst asunder; they were burst asunder.



Into their place stepped free competition, accompanied by a social and 

political constitution adapted in it, and the economic and political sway of 

the bourgeois class.



A similar movement is going on before our own eyes. Modern bourgeois 

society, with its relations of production, of exchange and of property, a 

society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of 

exchange, is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers 

of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells. For many a decade 

past, the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt 

of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production, against 

the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the 

bourgeois and of its rule. It is enough to mention the commercial crises 

that, by their periodical return, put the existence of the entire bourgeois 

society on its trial, each time more threateningly. In these crises, a great 

part not only of the existing products, but also of the previously created 

productive forces, are periodically destroyed. In these crises, there breaks 

out an epidemic that, in all earlier epochs, would have seemed an absurdity 

-- the epidemic of over-production. Society suddenly finds itself put back 

into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal 

war of devastation, had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; 

industry and commerce seem to be destroyed. And why? Because there is too 

much civilization, too much means of subsistence, too much industry, too 

much commerce. The productive forces at the disposal of society no longer 

tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property; on 

the contrary, they have become too powerful for these conditions, by which 

they are fettered, and so soon as they overcome these fetters, they bring 

disorder into the whole of bourgeois society, endanger the existence of 

bourgeois property. The conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to 

comprise the wealth created by them. And how does the bourgeoisie get over 

these crises? One the one hand, by enforced destruction of a mass of 

productive forces; on the other, by the conquest of new markets, and by the 

more thorough exploitation of the old ones. That is to say, by paving the 

way for more extensive and more destructive crises, and by diminishing the 

means whereby crises are prevented.



The weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are 

now turned against the bourgeoisie itself.



But not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to 

itself; it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those 

weapons -- the modern working class -- the proletarians.



In proportion as the bourgeoisie, i.e., capital, is developed, in the same 

proportion is the proletariat, the modern working class, developed -- a 

class of laborers, who live only so long as they find work, and who find 

work only so long as their labor increases capital. These laborers, who must 

sell themselves piecemeal, are a commodity, like every other article of 

commerce, and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of 

competition, to all the fluctuations of the market.



Owing to the extensive use of machinery, and to the division of labor, the 

work of the proletarians has lost all individual character, and, 

consequently, all charm for the workman. He becomes an appendage of the 

machine, and it is only the most simple, most monotonous, and most easily 

acquired knack, that is required of him. Hence, the cost of production of a 

workman is restricted, almost entirely, to the means of subsistence that he 

requires for maintenance, and for the propagation of his race. But the price 

of a commodity, and therefore also of labor, is equal to its cost of 

production. In proportion, therefore, as the repulsiveness of the work 

increases, the wage decreases. What is more, in proportion as the use of 

machinery and division of labor increases, in the same proportion the burden 

of toil also increases, whether by prolongation of the working hours, by the 

increase of the work exacted in a given time, or by increased speed of 

machinery, etc.



Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master 

into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of laborers, 

crowded into the factory, are organized like soldiers. As privates of the 

industrial army, they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of 

officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and 

of the bourgeois state; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, 

by the overlooker, and, above all, in the individual bourgeois manufacturer 

himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and 

aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.



The less the skill and exertion of strength implied in manual labor, in 

other words, the more modern industry becomes developed, the more is the 

labor of men superseded by that of women. Differences of age and sex have no 

longer any distinctive social validity for the working class. All are 

instruments of labor, more or less expensive to use, according to their age 

and sex.



No sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer, so far at 

an end, that he receives his wages in cash, than he is set upon by the other 

portion of the bourgeoisie, the landlord, the shopkeeper, the pawnbroker, 

etc. 



The lower strata of the middle class -- the small tradespeople, shopkeepers, 

and retired tradesmen generally, the handicraftsmen and peasants -- all 

these sink gradually into the proletariat, partly because their diminutive 

capital does not suffice for the scale on which Modern Industry is carried 

on, and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists, partly 

because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by new methods of 

production. Thus, the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the 

population.



The proletariat goes through various stages of development. With its birth 

begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie. At first, the contest is carried 

on by individual laborers, then by the work of people of a factory, then by 

the operative of one trade, in one locality, against the individual 

bourgeois who directly exploits them. They direct their attacks not against 

the bourgeois condition of production, but against the instruments of 

production themselves; they destroy imported wares that compete with their 

labor, they smash to pieces machinery, they set factories ablaze, they seek 

to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the Middle Ages.



At this stage, the laborers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the 

whole country, and broken up by their mutual competition. If anywhere they 

unite to form more compact bodies, this is not yet the consequence of their 

own active union, but of the union of the bourgeoisie, which class, in order 

to attain its own political ends, is compelled to set the whole proletariat 

in motion, and is moreover yet, for a time, able to do so. At this stage, 

therefore, the proletarians do not fight their enemies, but the enemies of 

their enemies, the remnants of absolute monarchy, the landowners, the 

non-industrial bourgeois, the petty bourgeois. Thus, the whole historical 

movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie; every victory so 

obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie.



But with the development of industry, the proletariat not only increases in 

number; it becomes concentrated in greater masses, its strength grows, and 

it feels that strength more. The various interests and conditions of life 

within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalized, in 

proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labor, and nearly 

everywhere reduces wages to the same low level. The growing competition 

among the bourgeois, and the resulting commercial crises, make the wages of 

the workers ever more fluctuating. The increasing improvement of machinery, 

ever more rapidly developing, makes their livelihood more and more 

precarious; the collisions between individual workmen and individual 

bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two 

classes. Thereupon, the workers begin to form combinations (trade unions) 

against the bourgeois; they club together in order to keep up the rate of 

wages; they found permanent associations in order to make provision 

beforehand for these occasional revolts. Here and there, the contest breaks 

out into riots.



Now and then the workers are victorious, but only for a time. The real fruit 

of their battles lie not in the immediate result, but in the ever expanding 

union of the workers. This union is helped on by the improved means of 

communication that are created by Modern Industry, and that place the 

workers of different localities in contact with one another. It was just 

this contact that was needed to centralize the numerous local struggles, all 

of the same character, into one national struggle between classes. But every 

class struggle is a political struggle. And that union, to attain which the 

burghers of the Middle Ages, with their miserable highways, required 

centuries, the modern proletarian, thanks to railways, achieve in a few 

years.



This organization of the proletarians into a class, and, consequently, into 

a political party, is continually being upset again by the competition 

between the workers themselves. But it ever rises up again, stronger, 

firmer, mightier. It compels legislative recognition of particular interests 

of the workers, by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie 

itself. Thus, the Ten-Hours Bill in England was carried.



Altogether, collisions between the classes of the old society further in 

many ways the course of development of the proletariat. The bourgeoisie 

finds itself involved in a constant battle. At first with the aristocracy; 

later on, with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself, whose interests 

have become antagonistic to the progress of industry; at all time with the 

bourgeoisie of foreign countries. In all these battles, it sees itself 

compelled to appeal to the proletariat, to ask for help, and thus to drag it 

into the political arena. The bourgeoisie itself, therefore, supplies the 

proletariat with its own elements of political and general education, in 

other words, it furnishes the proletariat with weapons for fighting the 

bourgeoisie.



Further, as we have already seen, entire sections of the ruling class are, 

by the advance of industry, precipitated into the proletariat, or are at 

least threatened in their conditions of existence. These also supply the 

proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress.



Finally, in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour, the 

progress of dissolution going on within the ruling class, in fact within the 

whole range of old society, assumes such a violent, glaring character, that 

a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift, and joins the 

revolutionary class, the class that holds the future in its hands. Just as, 

therefore, at an earlier period, a section of the nobility went over to the 

bourgeoisie, so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the 

proletariat, and in particular, a portion of the bourgeois ideologists, who 

have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the 

historical movement as a whole.



Of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie today, the 

proletariat alone is a genuinely revolutionary class. The other classes 

decay and finally disappear in the face of Modern Industry; the proletariat 

is its special and essential product.



The lower middle class, the small manufacturer, the shopkeeper, the artisan, 

the peasant, all these fight against the bourgeoisie, to save from 

extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class. They are 

therefore not revolutionary, but conservative. Nay, more, they are 

reactionary, for they try to roll back the wheel of history. If, by chance, 

they are revolutionary, they are only so in view of their impending transfer 

into the proletariat; they thus defend not their present, but their future 

interests; they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of 

the proletariat.



The "dangerous class", the social scum, that passively rotting mass thrown 

off by the lowest layers of the old society, may, here and there, be swept 

into the movement by a proletarian revolution; its conditions of life, 

however, prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary 

intrigue.



In the condition of the proletariat, those of old society at large are 

already virtually swamped. The proletarian is without property; his relation 

to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois 

family relations; modern industry labor, modern subjection to capital, the 

same in England as in France, in America as in Germany, has stripped him of 

every trace of national character. Law, morality, religion, are to him so 

many bourgeois prejudices, behind which lurk in ambush just as many 

bourgeois interests.



All the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their 

already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions 

of appropriation. The proletarians cannot become masters of the productive 

forces of society, except by abolishing their own previous mode of 

appropriation, and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation. 

They have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify; their mission is to 

destroy all previous securities for, and insurances of, individual property.



All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the 

interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, 

independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense 

majority. The proletariat, the lowest stratum of our present society, cannot 

stir, cannot raise itself up, without the whole superincumbent strata of 

official society being sprung into the air.



Though not in substance, yet in form, the struggle of the proletariat with 

the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle. The proletariat of each 

country must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own 

bourgeoisie. 



In depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat, 

we traced the more or less veiled civil war, raging within existing society, 

up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution, and where 

the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of 

the proletariat.



Hitherto, every form of society has been based, as we have already seen, on 

the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes. But in order to oppress 

a class, certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can, at 

least, continue its slavish existence. The serf, in the period of serfdom, 

raised himself to membership in the commune, just as the petty bourgeois, 

under the yoke of the feudal absolutism, managed to develop into a 

bourgeois. The modern laborer, on the contrary, instead of rising with the 

process of industry, sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of 

existence of his own class. He becomes a pauper, and pauperism develops more 

rapidly than population and wealth. And here it becomes evident that the 

bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society, and to 

impose its conditions of existence upon society as an overriding law. It is 

unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave 

within his slavery, because it cannot help letting him sink into such a 

state, that it has to feed him, instead of being fed by him. Society can no 

longer live under this bourgeoisie, in other words, its existence is no 

longer compatible with society.



The essential conditions for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois 

class is the formation and augmentation of capital; the condition for 

capital is wage labor. Wage labor rests exclusively on competition between 

the laborers. The advance of industry, whose involuntary promoter is the 

bourgeoisie, replaces the isolation of the laborers, due to competition, by 

the revolutionary combination, due to association. The development of Modern 

Industry, therefore, cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which 

the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products. What the bourgeoisie 

therefore produces, above all, are its own grave-diggers. Its fall and the 

victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable.







                    FOOTNOTES







[1] By bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists, owners of the 

means of social production and employers of wage labor.



By proletariat, the class of modern wage laborers who, having no means of 

production of their own, are reduced to selling their labor power in order 

to live. [Note by Engels - 1888 English edition]



[2] That is, all written history. In 1847, the pre-history of society, the 

social organization existing previous to recorded history, all but unknown. 

Since then, August von Haxthausen (1792-1866) discovered common ownership of 

land in Russia, Georg Ludwig von Maurer proved it to be the social 

foundation from which all Teutonic races started in history, and, by and by, 

village communities were found to be, or to have been, the primitive form of 

society everywhere from India to Ireland. The inner organization of this 

primitive communistic society was laid bare, in its typical form, by Lewis 

Henry Morgan's (1818-1861) crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens 

and its relation to the tribe. With the dissolution of the primeaval 

communities, society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally 

antagonistic classes. I have attempted to retrace this dissolution in Der 

Ursprung der Familie, des Privateigenthumus und des Staats, second edition, 

Stuttgart, 1886. [Engels, 1888 English edition]

and France, after they had purchased or conquered their initial rights of 

self-government from their feudal lords. [Engels: 1890 German edition]

had conquered from their feudal lords and masters local self-government and 

political rights as the "Third Estate". Generally speaking, for the 

economical development of the bourgeoisie, England is here taken as the 

typical country, for its political development, France. [Engels: 1888

                         II



          PROLETARIANS AND COMMUNISTS







In what relation do the Communists stand to the proletarians as a whole? The 

Communists do not form a separate party opposed to the other working-class 

parties.



They have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a 

whole.



They do not set up any sectarian principles of their own, by which to shape 

and mold the proletarian movement.



The Communists are distinguished from the other working-class parties by 

this only:



     (1) In the national struggles of the proletarians of the different

     countries, they point out and bring to the front the common

     interests of the entire proletariat, independently of all

     nationality.



     (2) In the various stages of development which the struggle of

     the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through,

     they always and everywhere represent the interests of the

     movement as a whole.



The Communists, therefore, are on the one hand practically, the most 

advanced and resolute section of the working-class parties of every country, 

that section which pushes forward all others; on the other hand, 

theoretically, they have over the great mass of the proletariat the 

advantage of clearly understanding the lines of march, the conditions, and 

the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement.



The immediate aim of the Communists is the same as that of all other 

proletarian parties: Formation of the proletariat into a class, overthrow of 

the bourgeois supremacy, conquest of political power by the proletariat.



The theoretical conclusions of the Communists are in no way based on ideas 

or principles that have been invented, or discovered, by this or that 

would-be universal reformer.



They merely express, in general terms, actual relations springing from an 

existing class struggle, from a historical movement going on under our very 

eyes. The abolition of existing property relations is not at all a 

distinctive feature of communism.



All property relations in the past have continually been subject to 

historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions.



The French Revolution, for example, abolished feudal property in favor of 

bourgeois property.



The distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property 

generally, but the abolition of bourgeois property. But modern bourgeois 

private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of 

producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms, on 

the exploitation of the many by the few.



In this sense, the theory of the Communists may be summed up in the single 

sentence: Abolition of private property.



We Communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right 

of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a man's own labor, which 

property is alleged to be the groundwork of all personal freedom, activity 

and independence.



Hard-won, self-acquired, self-earned property! Do you mean the property of 

petty artisan and of the small peasant, a form of property that preceded the 

bourgeois form? There is no need to abolish that; the development of 

industry has to a great extent already destroyed it, and is still destroying 

it daily. 



Or do you mean the modern bourgeois private property?



But does wage labor create any property for the laborer? Not a bit. It 

creates capital, i.e., that kind of property which exploits wage labor, and 

which cannot increase except upon conditions of begetting a new supply of 

wage labor for fresh exploitation. Property, in its present form, is based 

on the antagonism of capital and wage labor. Let us examine both sides of 

this antagonism.



To be a capitalist, is to have not only a purely personal, but a social 

STATUS in production. Capital is a collective product, and only by the 

united action of many members, nay, in the last resort, only by the united 

action of all members of society, can it be set in motion.



Capital is therefore not only personal; it is a social power.



When, therefore, capital is converted into common property, into the 

property of all members of society, personal property is not thereby 

transformed into social property. It is only the social character of the 

property that is changed. It loses its class character.



Let us now take wage labor.



The average price of wage labor is the minimum wage, i.e., that quantum of 

the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the laborer 

in bare existence as a laborer. What, therefore, the wage laborer 

appropriates by means of his labor merely suffices to prolong and reproduce 

a bare existence. We by no means intend to abolish this personal 

appropriation of the products of labor, an appropriation that is made for 

the maintenance and reproduction of human life, and that leaves no surplus 

wherewith to command the labor of others. All that we want to do away with 

is the miserable character of this appropriation, under which the laborer 

lives merely to increase capital, and is allowed to live only in so far as 

the interest of the ruling class requires it. 



In bourgeois society, living labor is but a means to increase accumulated 

labor. In communist society, accumulated labor is but a means to widen, to 

enrich, to promote the existence of the laborer.



In bourgeois society, therefore, the past dominates the present; in 

communist society, the present dominates the past. In bourgeois society, 

capital is independent and has individuality, while the living person is 

dependent and has no individuality.



And the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois, 

abolition of individuality and freedom! And rightly so. The abolition of 

bourgeois individuality, bourgeois independence, and bourgeois freedom is 

undoubtedly aimed at.



By freedom is meant, under the present bourgeois conditions of production, 

free trade, free selling and buying.



But if selling and buying disappears, free selling and buying disappears 

also. This talk about free selling and buying, and all the other "brave 

words" of our bourgeois about freedom in general, have a meaning, if any, 

only in contrast with restricted selling and buying, with the fettered 

traders of the Middle Ages, but have no meaning when opposed to the 

communist abolition of buying and selling, or the bourgeois conditions of 

production, and of the bourgeoisie itself.



You are horrified at our intending to do away with private property. But in 

your existing society, private property is already done away with for 

nine-tenths of the population; its existence for the few is solely due to 

its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths. You reproach us, 

therefore, with intending to do away with a form of property, the necessary 

condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the 

immense majority of society.



In one word, you reproach us with intending to do away with your property. 

Precisely so; that is just what we intend.



>From the moment when labor can no longer be converted into capital, money, 

or rent, into a social power capable of being monopolized, i.e., from the 

moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois 

property, into capital, from that moment, you say, individuality vanishes.



You must, therefore, confess that by "individual" you mean no other person 

than the bourgeois, than the middle-class owner of property. This person 

must, indeed, be swept out of the way, and made impossible.



Communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of 

society; all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the 

labor of others by means of such appropriations.



It has been objected that upon the abolition of private property, all

work will cease, and universal laziness will overtake us.



According to this, bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs 

through sheer idleness; for those who acquire anything, do not work. The 

whole of this objection is but another expression of the tautology: There 

can no longer be any wage labor when there is no longer any capital.



All objections urged against the communistic mode of producing and 

appropriating material products, have, in the same way, been urged against 

the communistic mode of producing and appropriating intellectual products. 

Just as to the bourgeois, the disappearance of class property is the 

disappearance of production itself, so the disappearance of class culture is 

to him identical with the disappearance of all culture.



That culture, the loss of which he laments, is, for the enormous majority, a 

mere training to act as a machine.



But don't wrangle with us so long as you apply, to our intended abolition of 

bourgeois property, the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom, 

culture, law, etc. Your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions 

of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property, just as your 

jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all, a will 

whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical 

conditions of existence of your class.



The selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of 

nature and of reason the social forms stringing from your present mode of 

production and form of property -- historical relations that rise and 

disappear in the progress of production -- this misconception you share with 

every ruling class that has preceded you. What you see clearly in the case 

of ancient property, what you admit in the case of feudal property, you are 

of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of 

property.



Abolition of the family! Even the most radical flare up at this infamous 

proposal of the Communists.



On what foundation is the present family, the bourgeois family, based? On 

capital, on private gain. In its completely developed form, this family 

exists only among the bourgeoisie. But this state of things finds its 

complement in the practical absence of the family among proletarians, and in 

public prostitution.



The bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement 

vanishes, and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital.



Do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their 

parents? To this crime we plead guilty.



But, you say, we destroy the most hallowed of relations, when we replace 

home education by social.



And your education! Is not that also social, and determined by the social 

conditions under which you educate, by the intervention direct or indirect, 

of society, by means of schools, etc.? The Communists have not intended the 

intervention of society in education; they do but seek to alter the 

character of that intervention, and to rescue education from the influence 

of the ruling class.



The bourgeois claptrap about the family and education, about the hallowed 

correlation of parents and child, becomes all the more disgusting, the more, 

by the action of Modern Industry, all the family ties among the proletarians 

are torn asunder, and their children transformed into simple articles of 

commerce and instruments of labor.



But you Communists would introduce community of women, screams the 

bourgeoisie in chorus.



The bourgeois sees his wife a mere instrument of production. He hears that 

the instruments of production are to be exploited in common, and, naturally, 

can come to no other conclusion that the lot of being common to all will 

likewise fall to the women.



He has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with 

the status of women as mere instruments of production.



For the rest, nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of 

our bourgeois at the community of women which, they pretend, is to be openly 

and officially established by the Communists. The Communists have no need to 

introduce free love; it has existed almost from time immemorial.



Our bourgeois, not content with having wives and daughters of their 

proletarians at their disposal, not to speak of common prostitutes, take the 

greatest pleasure in seducing each other's wives. (Ah, those were the days!) 



Bourgeois marriage is, in reality, a system of wives in common and thus, at 

the most, what the Communists might possibly be reproached with is that they 

desire to introduce, in substitution for a hypocritically concealed, an 

openly legalized system of free love. For the rest, it is self-evident that 

the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the 

abolition of free love springing from that system, i.e., of prostitution 

both public and private.



The Communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and 

nationality.



The working men have no country. We cannot take from them what they have not 

got. Since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy, 

must rise to be the leading class of the nation, must constitute itself the 

nation, it is, so far, itself national, though not in the bourgeois sense of 

the word.



National differences and antagonism between peoples are daily more and more 

vanishing, owing to the development of the bourgeoisie, to freedom of 

commerce, to the world market, to uniformity in the mode of production and 

in the conditions of life corresponding thereto.



The supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster. 

United action of the leading civilized countries at least is one of the 

first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat.



In proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another will also be 

put an end to, the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an 

end to. In proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation 

vanishes, the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end.



The charges against communism made from a religious, a philosophical and, 

generally, from an ideological standpoint, are not deserving of serious 

examination.



Does it require deep intuition to comprehend that man's ideas, views, and 

conception, in one word, man's consciousness, changes with every change in 

the conditions of his material existence, in his social relations and in his 

social life?



What else does the history of ideas prove, than that intellectual production 

changes its character in proportion as material production is changed? The 

ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class.



When people speak of the ideas that revolutionize society, they do but 

express that fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have 

been created, and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with 

the dissolution of the old conditions of existence.



When the ancient world was in its last throes, the ancient religions were 

overcome by Christianity. When Christian ideas succumbed in the eighteenth 

century to rationalist ideas, feudal society fought its death battle with 

the then revolutionary bourgeoisie. The ideas of religious liberty and 

freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition 

within the domain of knowledge.



"Undoubtedly," it will be said, "religious, moral, philosophical, and 

juridicial ideas have been modified in the course of historical development. 

But religion, morality, philosophy, political science, and law, constantly 

survived this change."



"There are, besides, eternal truths, such as Freedom, Justice, etc., that 

are common to all states of society. But communism abolishes eternal truths, 

it abolishes all religion, and all morality, instead of constituting them on 

a new basis; it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical 

experience."



What does this accusation reduce itself to? The history of all past society 

has consisted in the development of class antagonisms, antagonisms that 

assumed different forms at different epochs.



But whatever form they may have taken, one fact is common to all past ages, 

viz., the exploitation of one part of society by the other. No wonder, then, 

that the social consciousness of past ages, despite all the multiplicity and 

variety it displays, moves within certain common forms, or general ideas, 

which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class 

antagonisms.



The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional 

relations; no wonder that its development involved the most radical rupture 

with traditional ideas.



But let us have done with the bourgeois objections to communism.



We have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the working 

class is to raise the proletariat to the position of ruling class to win the 

battle of democracy.



The proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest, by degree, all 

capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralize all instruments of production in 

the hands of the state, i.e., of the proletariat organized as the ruling 

class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.



Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of 

despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of 

bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear 

economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the 

movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old 

social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the 

mode of production.



These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.



Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty 

generally applicable.



   1.Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of

     land to public purposes.



   2.A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.



   3.Abolition of all rights of inheritance.



   4.Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.



   5.Centralization of credit in the banks of the state, by means of a

     national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly.



   6.Centralization of the means of communication and transport in

     he hands of the state.



   7.Extension of factories and instruments of production owned

     by the state; the bringing into cultivation of waste lands, and

     the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a

     common plan.



   8.Equal obligation of all to work. Establishment of industrial

     armies, especially for agriculture.



   9.Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries;

     gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and

     country by a more equable distribution of the populace over

     the country.



  10.Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of

     children's factory labor in its present form. Combination of

     education with industrial production, etc.



When, in the course of development, class distinctions have disappeared, and 

all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of 

the whole nation, the public power will lose its political character. 

Political power, properly so called, is merely the organized power of one 

class for oppressing another. If the proletariat during its contest with the 

bourgeoisie is compelled, by the force of circumstances, to organize itself 

as a class; if, by means of a revolution, it makes itself the ruling class, 

and, as such, sweeps away by force the old conditions of production, then it 

will, along with these conditions, have swept away the conditions for the 

existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally, and will thereby 

have abolished its own supremacy as a class.



In place of the old bourgeois society, with its classes and class 

antagonisms, we shall have an association in which the free development of 

each is the condition for the free development of all.







                         III



            SOCIALIST AND COMMUNIST LITERATURE







                1. REACTIONARY SOCIALISM 



                   a. Feudal Socialism



Owing to their historical position, it became the vocation of the 

aristocracies of France and England to write pamphlets against modern 

bourgeois society. In the French Revolution of July 1830, and in the English 

reform agitation, these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful 

upstart. Thenceforth, a serious political struggle was altogether out of the 

question. A literary battle alone remained possible. But even in the domain 

of literature, the old cries of the restoration period had become 

impossible. [1]



In order to arouse sympathy, the aristocracy was obliged to lose sight, 

apparently, of its own interests, and to formulate its indictment against 

the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone. Thus, 

the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new masters 

and whispering in his ears sinister prophesies of coming catastrophe.



In this way arose feudal socialism: half lamentation, half lampoon; half an 

echo of the past, half menace of the future; at times, by its bitter, witty 

and incisive criticism, striking the bourgeoisie to the very heart's core, 

but always ludicrous in its effect, through total incapacity to comprehend 

the march of modern history.



The aristocracy, in order to rally the people to them, waved the proletarian 

alms-bag in front for a banner. But the people, so often as it joined them, 

saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms, and deserted with 

loud and irreverent laughter.



One section of the French Legitimists and "Young England" exhibited this 

spectacle:



In pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different to that of the 

bourgeoisie, the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances 

and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated. In 

showing that, under their rule, the modern proletariat never existed, they 

forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own 

form of society. 



For the rest, so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their 

criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeois amounts to this: 

that under the bourgeois regime a class is being developed which is destined 

to cut up, root and branch, the old order of society.



What they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a 

proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat.



In political practice, therefore, they join in all corrective measures 

against the working class; and in ordinary life, despite their high falutin' 

phrases, they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of 

industry, and to barter truth, love, and honor, for traffic in wool, 

beetroot-sugar, and potato spirits. [2]



As the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord, so has clerical 

socialism with feudal socialism.



Nothing is easier than to give Christian asceticism a socialist tinge. Has 

not Christianity declaimed against private property, against marriage, 

against the state? Has it not preached in the place of these, charity and 

poverty, celibacy and mortification of the flesh, monastic life and Mother 

Church? Christian socialism is but the holy water with which the priest 

consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat.



               b. Petty-Bourgeois Socialism



The feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the 

bourgeoisie, not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and 

perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society. The medieval 

burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the 

modern bourgeoisie. In those countries which are but little developed, 

industrially and commercially, these two classes still vegetate side by side 

with the rising bourgeoisie.



In countries where modern civilization has become fully developed, a new 

class of petty bourgeois has been formed, fluctuating between proletariat 

and bourgeoisie, and ever renewing itself a supplementary part of bourgeois 

society. The individual members of this class, however, as being constantly 

hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition, and, as 

Modern Industry develops, they even see the moment approaching when they 

will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society, to be 

replaced in manufactures, agriculture and commerce, by overlookers, bailiffs 

and shopmen.



In countries like France, where the peasants constitute far more than half 

of the population, it was natural that writers who sided with the 

proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use, in their criticism of the 

bourgeois regime, the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois, and from 

the standpoint of these intermediate classes, should take up the cudgels for 

the working class. Thus arose petty-bourgeois socialism. Sismondi was the 

head of this school, not only in France but also in England.



This school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions 

in the conditions of modern production. It laid bare the hypocritical 

apologies of economists. It proved, incontrovertibly, the disastrous effects 

of machinery and division of labor; the concentration of capital and land in 

a few hands; overproduction and crises; it pointed out the inevitable ruin 

of the petty bourgeois and peasant, the misery of the proletariat, the 

anarchy in production, the crying inequalities in the distribution of 

wealth, the industrial war of extermination between nations, the dissolution 

of old moral bonds, of the old family relations, of the old nationalities.



In it positive aims, however, this form of socialism aspires either to 

restoring the old means of production and of exchange, and with them the old 

property relations, and the old society, or to cramping the modern means of 

production and of exchange within the framework of the old property 

relations that have been, and were bound to be, exploded by those means. In 

either case, it is both reactionary and Utopian.



Its last words are: corporate guilds for manufacture; patriarchal relations 

in agriculture.



Ultimately, when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating 

effects of self-deception, this form of socialism ended in a miserable 

hangover.



               c. German or "True" Socialism



The socialist and communist literature of France, a literature that 

originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power, and that was the 

expressions of the struggle against this power, was introduced into Germany 

at a time when the bourgeoisie in that country had just begun its contest 

with feudal absolutism.



German philosophers, would-be philosophers, and beaux esprits (men of 

letters), eagerly seized on this literature, only forgetting that when these 

writings immigrated from France into Germany, French social conditions had 

not immigrated along with them. In contact with German social conditions, 

this French literature lost all its immediate practical significance and 

assumed a purely literary aspect. Thus, to the German philosophers of the 

eighteenth century, the demands of the first French Revolution were nothing 

more than the demands of "Practical Reason" in general, and the utterance of 

the will of the revolutionary French bourgeoisie signified, in their eyes, 

the laws of pure will, of will as it was bound to be, of true human will 

generally.



The work of the German literati consisted solely in bringing the new French 

ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience, or rather, 

in annexing the French ideas without deserting their own philosophic point 

of view.



This annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is 

appropriated, namely, by translation.



It is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of Catholic saints over the 

manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been 

written. The German literati reversed this process with the profane French 

literature. They wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the French 

original. For instance, beneath the French criticism of the economic 

functions of money, they wrote "alienation of humanity", and beneath the 

French criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote "dethronement of the 

category of the general", and so forth.



The introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the French 

historical criticisms, they dubbed "Philosophy of Action", "True Socialism", 

"German Science of Socialism", "Philosophical Foundation of Socialism", and 

so on.



The French socialist and communist literature was thus completely 

emasculated. And, since it ceased, in the hands of the German, to express 

the struggle of one class with the other, he felt conscious of having 

overcome "French one-sidedness" and of representing, not true requirements, 

but the requirements of truth; not the interests of the proletariat, but the 

interests of human nature, of man in general, who belongs to no class, has 

no reality, who exists only in the misty realm of philosophical fantasy.



This German socialism, which took its schoolboy task so seriously and 

solemnly, and extolled its poor stock-in-trade in such a mountebank fashion, 

meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence.



The fight of the Germans, and especially of the Prussian bourgeoisie, 

against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy, in other words, the 

liberal movement, became more earnest.



By this, the long-wished for opportunity was offered to "True" Socialism of 

confronting the political movement with the socialistic demands, of hurling 

the traditional anathemas against liberalism, against representative 

government, against bourgeois competition, bourgeois freedom of the press, 

bourgeois legislation, bourgeois liberty and equality, and of preaching to 

the masses that they had nothing to gain, and everything to lose, by this 

bourgeois movement. German socialism forgot, in the nick of time, that the 

French criticism, whose silly echo it was, presupposed the existence of 

modern bourgeois society, with its corresponding economic conditions of 

existence, and the political constitution adapted thereto, the very things 

those attainment was the object of the pending struggle in Germany.



To the absolute governments, with their following of parsons, professors, 

country squires, and officials, it served as a welcome scarecrow against the 

threatening bourgeoisie.



It was a sweet finish, after the bitter pills of flogging and bullets, with 

which these same governments, just at that time, dosed the German 

working-class risings.



While this "True" Socialism thus served the government as a weapon for 

fighting the German bourgeoisie, it, at the same time, directly represented 

a reactionary interest, the interest of German philistines. In Germany, the 

petty-bourgeois class, a relic of the sixteenth century, and since then 

constantly cropping up again under the various forms, is the real social 

basis of the existing state of things.



To preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in 

Germany. The industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens 

it with certain destruction -- on the one hand, from the concentration of 

capital; on the other, from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat. "True" 

Socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone. It spread like an 

epidemic.



The robe of speculative cobwebs, embroidered with flowers of rhetoric, 

steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment, this transcendental robe in which 

the German Socialists wrapped their sorry "eternal truths", all skin and 

bone, served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a 

public. And on its part German socialism recognized, more and more, its own 

calling as the bombastic representative of the petty-bourgeois philistine.



It proclaimed the German nation to be the model nation, and the German petty 

philistine to be the typical man. To every villainous meanness of this model 

man, it gave a hidden, higher, socialistic interpretation, the exact 

contrary of its real character. It went to the extreme length of directly 

opposing the "brutally destructive" tendency of communism, and of 

proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class struggles. With 

very few exceptions, all the so-called socialist and communist publications 

that now (1847) circulate in Germany belong to the domain of this foul and 

enervating literature. [3]



   2. CONSERVATIVE OR BOURGEOIS SOCIALISM 



A part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in 

order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society.



To this section belong economists, philanthropists, humanitarians, improvers 

of the condition of the working class, organizers of charity, members of 

societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals, temperance fanatics, 

hole-and-corner reformers of every imaginable kind. This form of socialism 

has, moreover, been worked out into complete systems.



We may cite Proudhon's Philosophy of Poverty as an example of this form.



The socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social 

conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting 

therefrom. They desire the existing state of society, minus its 

revolutionary and disintegrating elements. They wish for a bourgeoisie 

without a proletariat. The bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in 

which it is supreme to be the best; and bourgeois socialism develops this 

comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems. In 

requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system, and thereby to march 

straightaway into the social New Jerusalem, it but requires in reality that 

the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society, but 

should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeoisie.



A second, and more practical, but less systematic, form of this socialism 

sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working 

class by showing that no mere political reform, but only a change in the 

material conditions of existence, in economical relations, could be of any 

advantage to them. By changes in the material conditions of existence, this 

form of socialism, however, by no means understands abolition of the 

bourgeois relations of production, an abolition that can be affected only by 

a revolution, but administrative reforms, based on the continued existence 

of these relations; reforms, therefore, that in no respect affect the 

relations between capital and labor, but, at the best, lessen the cost, and 

simplify the administrative work of bourgeois government.



Bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression when, and only when, it 

becomes a mere figure of speech.



Free trade: for the benefit of the working class. Protective duties: for

the benefit of the working class. Prison reform: for the benefit of the

working class. This is the last word and the only seriously meant

word of bourgeois socialism.



It is summed up in the phrase: the bourgeois is a bourgeois -- for the 

benefit of the working class.



       3. CRITICAL-UTOPIAN SOCIALISM AND

                   COMMUNISM 



We do not here refer to that literature which, in every great modern 

revolution, has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat, such 

as the writings of Babeuf [4] and others.



The first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends, made in 

times of universal excitement, when feudal society was being overthrown, 

necessarily failed, owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat, 

as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation, 

conditions that had yet to be produced, and could be produced by the 

impending bourgeois epoch alone. The revolutionary literature that 

accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a 

reactionary character. It inculcated universal asceticism and social 

levelling in its crudest form.



The socialist and communist systems, properly so called, those of 

Saint-Simon [5], Fourier [6], Owen [7], and others, spring into existence in 

the early undeveloped period, described above, of the struggle between 

proletariat and bourgeoisie (see Section 1. Bourgeois and Proletarians).



The founders of these systems see, indeed, the class antagonisms, as well as 

the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society. 

But the proletariat, as yet in its infancy, offers to them the spectacle of 

a class without any historical initiative or any independent political 

movement.



Since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the 

development of industry, the economic situation, as they find it, does not 

as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the 

proletariat. They therefore search after a new social science, after new 

social laws, that are to create these conditions.



Historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action; 

historically created conditions of emancipation to fantastic ones; and the 

gradual, spontaneous class organization of the proletariat to an 

organization of society especially contrived by these inventors. Future 

history resolves itself, in their eyes, into the propaganda and the 

practical carrying out of their social plans.



In the formation of their plans, they are conscious of caring chiefly for 

the interests of the working class, as being the most suffering class. Only 

from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the 

proletariat exist for them.



The undeveloped state of the class struggle, as well as their own 

surroundings, causes Socialists of this kind to consider themselves far 

superior to all class antagonisms. They want to improve the condition of 

every member of society, even that of the most favored. Hence, they 

habitually appeal to society at large, without the distinction of class; 

nay, by preference, to the ruling class. For how can people when once they 

understand their system, fail to see in it the best possible plan of the 

best possible state of society? 



Hence, they reject all political, and especially all revolutionary action; 

they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means, necessarily doomed to 

failure, and by the force of example, to pave the way for the new social 

gospel.



Such fantastic pictures of future society, painted at a time when the 

proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a fantastic 

conception of its own position, correspond with the first instinctive 

yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society.



But these socialist and communist publications contain also a critical 

element. They attack every principle of existing society. Hence, they are 

full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working 

class. The practical measures proposed in them -- such as the abolition of 

the distinction between town and country, of the family, of the carrying on 

of industries for the account of private individuals, and of the wage 

system, the proclamation of social harmony, the conversion of the function 

of the state into a more superintendence of production -- all these 

proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were, 

at that time, only just cropping up, and which, in these publications, are 

recognized in their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only. These 

proposals, therefore, are of a purely utopian character.



The significance of critical-utopian socialism and communism bears an 

inverse relation to historical development. In proportion as the modern 

class struggle develops and takes definite shape, this fantastic standing 

apart from the contest, these fantastic attacks on it, lose all practical 

value and all theoretical justifications. Therefore, although the 

originators of these systems were, in many respects, revolutionary, their 

disciples have, in every case, formed mere reactionary sects. They hold fast 

by the original views of their masters, in opposition to the progressive 

historical development of the proletariat. They, therefore, endeavor, and 

that consistently, to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class 

antagonisms. They still dream of experimental realization of their social 

utopias, of founding isolated phalansteres, of establishing "Home Colonies", 

or setting up a "Little Icaria" [8] -- pocket editions of the New Jerusalem 

-- and to realize all these castles in the air, they are compelled to appeal 

to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois. By degrees, they sink into the 

category of the reactionary conservative socialists depicted above, 

differing from these only by more systematic pedantry, and by their 

fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social 

science.



They, therefore, violently oppose all political action on the part of the 

working class; such action, according to them, can only result from blind 

unbelief in the new gospel.



The Owenites in England, and the Fourierists in France, respectively, oppose 

the Chartists and the Reformistes.

           POSITION OF THE COMMUNISTS

                 IN RELATION TO THE

       VARIOUS EXISTING OPPOSITION PARTIES







Section II has made clear the relations of the Communists to the existing 

working-class parties, such as the Chartists in England and the Agrarian 

Reformers in America.



The Communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims, for the 

enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class; but in the 

movement of the present, they also represent and take care of the future of 

that movement. In France, the Communists ally with the Social Democrats * 

against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie, reserving, however, the 

right to take up a critical position in regard to phases and illusions 

traditionally handed down from the Great Revolution.



In Switzerland, they support the Radicals, without losing sight of the fact 

that this party consists of antagonistic elements, partly of Democratic 

Socialists, in the French sense, partly of radical bourgeois.



In Poland, they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as 

the prime condition for national emancipation, that party which fomented the 

insurrection of Krakow in 1846.



In Germany, they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a 

revolutionary way, against the absolute monarchy, the feudal squirearchy, 

and the petty-bourgeoisie.



But they never cease, for a single instant, to instill into the working 

class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between 

bourgeoisie and proletariat, in order that the German workers may 

straightway use, as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie, the social and 

political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along 

with its supremacy, and in order that, after the fall of the reactionary 

classes in Germany, the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately 

begin.



The Communists turn their attention chiefly to Germany, because that country 

is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out 

under more advanced conditions of European civilization and with a much more 

developed proletariat than that of England was in the seventeenth, and 

France in the eighteenth century, and because the bourgeois revolution in 

Germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian 

revolution.



In short, the Communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement 

against the existing social and political order of things.



In all these movements, they bring to the front, as the leading question in 

each, the property question, no matter what its degree of development at the 

time.



Finally, they labor everywhere for the union and agreement of the

democratic parties of all countries.



The Communists disdain to conceal their views and aims. They openly declare 

that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all 

existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at a communist 

revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They 

have a world to win.



Working men of all countries, unite!

      PREFACE TO 1872 GERMAN EDITION







The Communist League, an international association of workers, which could 

of course be only a secret one, under conditions obtaining at the time, 

commissioned us, the undersigned, at the Congress held in London in November 

1847, to write for publication a detailed theoretical and practical 

programme for the Party. Such was the origin of the following Manifesto, the 

manuscript of which travelled to London to be printed a few weeks before the 

February Revolution. First published in German, it has been republished in 

that language in at least twelve different editions in Germany, England, and 

America. It was published in English for the first time in 1850 in the Red 

Republican, London, translated by Miss Helen Macfarlane, and in 1871 in at 

least three different translations in America. The french version first 

appeared in Paris shortly before the June insurrection of 1848, and recently 

in Le Socialiste of New York. A new translation is in the course of 

preparation. A Polish version appeared in London shortly after it was first 

published in Germany. A Russian translation was published in Geneva in the 

'sixties. Into Danish, too, it was translated shortly after its appearance. 



However much that state of things may have altered during the last 

twenty-five years, the general principles laid down in the Manifesto are, on 

the whole, as correct today as ever. Here and there, some detail might be 

improved. The practical application of the principles will depend, as the 

Manifesto itself states, everywhere and at all times, on the historical 

conditions for the time being existing, and, for that reason, no special 

stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of Section 

II. That passage would, in many respects, be very differently worded today. 

In view of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since 1848, and of the 

accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class, in 

view of the practical experience gained, first in the February Revolution, 

and then, still more, in the Paris Commune, where the proletariat for the 

first time held political power for two whole months, this programme has in 

some details been antiquated. One thing especially was proved by the 

Commune, viz., that "the working class cannot simply lay hold of ready-made 

state machinery, and wield it for its own purposes." (See The Civil War in 

France: Address of the General Council of the International Working Men's 

Assocation, 1871, where this point is further developed.) Further, it is 

self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in 

relation to the present time, because it comes down only to 1847; also that 

the remarks on the relation of the Communists to the various opposition 

parties (Section IV), although, in principle still correct, yet in practice 

are antiquated, because the political situation has been entirely changed, 

and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion 

of the political parties there enumerated.



But then, the Manifesto has become a historical document which we have no 

longer any right to alter. A subsequent edition may perhaps appear with an 

introduction bridging the gap from 1847 to the present day; but this reprint 

was too unexpected to leave us time for that.

      PREFACE TO 1882 RUSSIAN EDITION







The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the Communist Party, 

translated by Bakunin, was published early in the 'sixties by the printing 

office of the Kolokol. Then the West could see in it (the Russian edition of 

the Manifesto) only a literary curiosity. Such a view would be impossible 

today.



What a limited field the proletarian movement occupied at that time 

(December 1847) is most clearly shown by the last section: the position of 

the Communists in relation to the various opposition parties in various 

countries. Precisely Russia and the United States are missing here. It was 

the time when Russia constituted the last great reserve of all European 

reaction, when the United States absorbed the surplus proletarian forces of 

Europe through immigration. Both countries provided Europe with raw 

materials and were at the same time markets for the sale of its industrial 

products. Bother were, therefore, in one way of another, pillars of the 

existing European system.



How very different today. Precisely European immigration fitted North 

American for a gigantic agricultural production, whose competition is 

shaking the very foundations of European landed property -- large and small. 

At the same time, it enabled the United States to exploit its tremendous 

industrial resources with an energy and on a scale that must shortly break 

the industrial monopoly of Western Europe, and especially of England, 

existing up to now. Both circumstances react in a revolutionary manner upon 

America itself. Step by step, the small and middle land ownership of the 

farmers, the basis of the whole political constitution, is succumbing to the

competition of giant farms; at the same time, a mass industrial

proletariat and a fabulous concentration of capital funds are

developing for the first time in the industrial regions.



And now Russia! During the Revolution of 1848-9, not only the European 

princes, but the European bourgeois as well, found their only salvation from 

the proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian intervention. The Tsar 

was proclaimed the chief of European reaction. Today, he is a prisoner of 

war of the revolution in Gatchina, and Russia forms the vanguard of 

revolutionary action in Europe.



The Communist Manifesto had, as its object, the proclamation of the 

inevitable impending dissolution of modern bourgeois property. But in Russia 

we find, face-to-face with the rapidly flowering capitalist swindle and 

bourgeois property, just beginning to develop, more than half the land owned 

in common by the peasants. Now the question is: can the Russian obshchina, 

though greatly undermined, yet a form of primeaval common ownership of land, 

pass directly to the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or, on the 

contrary, must it first pass through the same process of dissolution such as 

constitutes the historical evolution of the West?



The only answer to that possible today is this: If the Russian Revolution 

becomes the signal for a proletarian revolution in the West, so that both 

complement each other, the present Russian common ownership of land may 

serve as the starting point for a communist development.

      PREFACE TO 1883 GERMAN EDITION







The preface to the present edition I must, alas, sign alone. Marx, the man 

to whom the whole working class class of Europe and America owes more than 

to any one else -- rests at Highgate Cemetary and over his grave the first 

first grass is already growing. Since his death [March 13, 1883], there can 

be even less thought of revising or supplementing the Manifesto. But I 

consider it all the more necessary again to state the following expressly:



The basic thought running through the Manifesto -- that economic production, 

and the structure of society of every historical epoch necessarily arising 

therefrom, constitute the foundation for the political and intellectual 

history of that epoch; that consequently (ever since the dissolution of the 

primaeval communal ownership of land) all history has been a history of 

class struggles, of struggles between exploited and exploiting, between 

dominated and dominating classes at various stages of social evolution; that 

this struggle, however, has now reached a stage where the exploited and 

oppressed class (the proletariat) can no longer emancipate itself from the 

class which exploits and oppresses it (the bourgeoisie), without at the same 

time forever freeing the whole of society from exploitation, oppression, 

class struggles -- this basic thought belongs soley and exclusively to Marx.



     [ENGELS FOOTNOTE TO PARAGRAPH: "This

     proposition", I wrote in the preface to the English

     translation, "which, in my opinion, is destined to do for

     history what Darwin's theory has done for biology, we

     both of us, had been gradually approaching for some

     years before 1845. How far I had independently

     progressed towards it is best shown by my Conditions

     of the Working Class in England. But when I again

     met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it already

     worked out and put it before me in terms almost as

     clear as those in which I have stated it here."] 



I have already stated this many times; but precisely now is it necessary 

that it also stand in front of the Manifesto itself.

      PREFACE TO 1888 ENGLISH EDITION







The Manifesto was published as the platform of the Communist League, a 

working men's association, first exclusively German, later on international, 

and under the political conditions of the Continent before 1848, unavoidably 

a secret society. At a Congress of the League, held in November 1847, Marx 

and Engels were commissioned to prepare a complete theoretical and practical 

party programme. Drawn up in German, in January 1848, the manuscript was 

sent to the printer in London a few weeks before the French Revolution of 

February 24. A French translation was brought out in Paris shortly before 

the insurrection of June 1848. The first English translation, by Miss Helen 

Macfarlane, appeared in George Julian Harney's Red Republican, London, 1850. 

A Danish and a Polish edition had also been published.



The defeat of the Parisian insurrection of June 1848 -- the first great 

battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie -- drove again into the 

background, for a time, the social and political aspirations of the European 

working class. Thenceforth, the struggle for supremacy was, again, as it had 

been before the Revolution of February, solely between different sections of 

the propertied class; the working class was reduced to a fight for political 

elbow-room, and to the position of extreme wing of the middle-class 

Radicals. Wherever independent proletarian movements continued to show signs 

of life, they were ruthlessly hunted down. Thus the Prussian police hunted 

out the Central Board of the Communist League, then located in Cologne. The 

members were arrested and, after eighteen months' imprisonment, they were 

tried in October 1852. This selebrated "Cologne Communist Trial" lasted from 

October 4 till November 12; seven of the prisoners were sentenced to terms 

of imprisonment in a fortress, varying from three to six years. Immediately 

after the sentence, the League was formlly dissolved by the remaining 

members. As to the Manifesto, it seemed henceforth doomed to oblivion.



When the European workers had recovered sufficient strength for another 

attack on the ruling classes, the International Working Men's Association 

sprang up. But this association, formed with the express aim of welding into 

one body the whole militant proletariat of Europe and America, could not at 

once proclaim the principles laid down in the Manifesto. The International 

was bound to have a programme broad enough to be acceptable to the English 

trade unions, to the followers of Proudhon in France, Belgium, Italy, and 

Spain, and to the Lassalleans in Germany.



[ENGEL'S FOOTNOTE: Lassalle personally, to us, always acknowledged himself 

to be a disciple of Marx, and, as such, stood on the ground of the 

Manifesto. But in his first public agitation, 1862-1864, he did not go 

beyond demanding co-operative worhsops supported by state credit.]



Marx, who drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties, 

entirely trusted to the intellectual development of the working class, which 

was sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion. The very 

events and vicissitudes in the struggle against capital, the defeats even 

more than the victories, could not help bringing home to men's minds the 

insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums, and preparing the way for 

a more complete insight into the true conditions for working-class 

emancipation. And Marx was right. The International, on its breaking in 

1874, left the workers quite different men from what it found them in 1864. 

Proudhonism in France, Lassalleanism in Germany, were dying out, and even 

the conservative English trade unions, though most of them had long since 

severed their connection with the International, were gradually advancing 

towards that point at which, last year at Swansea, their president could say 

in their name: "Continental socialism has lost its terror for us." In fact, 

the principles of the Manifesto had made considerable headway among the 

working men of all countries. 



The Manifesto itself came thus to the front again. Since 1850, the German 

text had been reprinted several times in Switzerland, England, and America. 

In 1872, it was translated into English in New York, where the translation 

was published in Woorhull and Claflin's Weekly. From this English version, a 

French one was made in Le Socialiste of New York. Since then, at least two 

more English translations, moer or less mutilated, have been brought out in 

America, and one of them has been reprinted in England. The first Russian 

translation, made by Bakunin, was published at Herzen's Kolokol office in 

Geneva, about 1863; a second one, by the heroic Vera Zasulich, also in 

Geneva, in 1882. A new Danish edition is to be found in Socialdemokratisk 

Bibliothek, Copenhagen, 1885; a fresh French translation in Le Socialiste, 

Paris, 1886. From this latter, a Spanish version was prepared and published 

in Madrid, 1886. The German reprints are not to be counted; there have been 

twelve altogether at the least. An Armenian translation, which was to be 

published in Constantinople some months ago, did not see the light, I am 

told, because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name 

of Marx on it, while the translator declined to call it his own production. 

Of further translations into other languages I have heard but had not seen. 

Thus the history of the Manifesto reflects the history of the modern 

working-class movement; at present, it is doubtless the most wide spread, 

the most international production of all socialist literature, the common 

platform acknowledged by millions of working men from Siberia to California.



Yet, when it was written, we could not have called it a socialist manifesto. 

By Socialists, in 1847, were understood, on the one hand the adherents of 

the various Utopian systems: Owenites in England, Fourierists in France, 

both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects, and gradually 

dying out; on the other hand, the most multifarious social quacks who, by 

all manner of tinkering, professed to redress, without any danger to capital 

and profit, all sorts of social grievances, in both cases men outside the 

working-class movement, and looking rather to the "educated" classes for 

support. Whatever portion of the working class had become convinced of the 

insufficiency of mere political revolutions, and had proclaimed the 

necessity of total social change, called itself Communist. It was a crude, 

rough-hewn, purely instinctive sort of communism; still, it touched the 

cardinal point and was powerful enough amongst the working class to produce 

the Utopian communism of Cabet in France, and of Weitling in Germany. Thus, 

in 1847, socialism was a middle-class movement, communism a working-class 

movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least, "respectable"; communism 

was the very opposite. And as our notion, from the very beginning, was that 

"the emancipation of the workers must be the act of the working class 

itself," there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take. 

Moreover, we have, ever since, been far from repudiating it.



The Manifesto being our joint production, I consider myself bound to state 

that the fundamental proposition which forms the nucleus belongs to Marx. 

That proposition is: That in every historical epoch, th prevailing mode of 

economic production and exchange, and the social organization necessarily 

following from it, form the basis upon which it is built up, and from that 

which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that 

epoch; that consequently the whole history of mankind (since the dissolution 

of primitive tribal society, holding land in common ownership) has been a 

history of class struggles, contests between exploiting and exploited, 

ruling and oppressed classes; That the history of these class struggles 

forms a series of evolutions in which, nowadays, a stage has been reached 

where the exploited and oppressed class -- the proletariat -- cannot attain 

its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class -- the 

bourgeoisie -- without, at the same time, and once and for all, emancipating 

society at large from all exploitation, oppression, class distinction, and 

class struggles.



This proposition, which, in my opinion, is destined to do for history what 

Darwin's theory has done for biology, we both of us, had been gradually 

approaching for some years before 1845. How far I had independently 

progressed towards it is best shown by my Conditions of the Working Class in 

England. But when I again met Marx at Brussels, in spring 1845, he had it 

already worked out and put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in 

which I have stated it here.



From our joint preface to the German edition of 1872, I quote the following: 



     "However much that state of things may have altered

     during the last twenty-five years, the general principles

     laid down in the Manifesto are, on the whole, as

     correct today as ever. Here and there, some detail

     might be improved. The practical application of the

     principles will depend, as the Manifesto itself states,

     everywhere and at all times, on the historical conditions

     for the time being existing, and, for that reason, no

     special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures

     proposed at the end of Section II. That passage would,

     in many respects, be very differently worded today. In

     view of the gigantic strides of Modern Industry since

     1848, and of the accompanying improved and

     extended organization of the working class, in view of

     the practical experience gained, first in the February

     Revolution, and then, still more, in the Paris Commune,

     where the proletariat for the first time held political

     power for two whole months, this programme has in

     some details been antiquated. One thing especially was

     where this point is further developed.) Further, it is

     self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature is

     deficient in relation to the present time, because it

     comes down only to 1847; also that the remarks on the

     of the political parties there enumerated. 



     "But then, the Manifesto has become a historical

     document which we have no longer any right to alter."



The present translation is by Mr Samuel Moore, the translator of the greater 

portion of Marx's Capital. We have revised it in common, and I have added a 

few notes explanatory of historical allusions.

      PREFACE TO 1890 GERMAN EDITION







Since [the 1883 German edition preface] was written, a new German edition of 

the Manifesto has again become necessary, and much has also happened to the 

Manifesto which should be recorded here.



A second Russian translation -- by Vera Zasulich -- appeared in Geneva in 

1882; the preface to that edition was written by Marx and myself. 

Unfortunately, the original German manuscript has gone astray; I must 

therefore retranslate from the Russian which will in no way improve the 

text. It reads: 



     "The first Russian edition of the Manifesto of the

     Communist Party, translated by Bakunin, was

     published early in the 'sixties by the printing office of the

     Kolokol. Then the West could see in it (the Russian

     edition of the Manifesto) only a literary curiosity. Such

     a view would be impossible today. 



     "What a limited field the proletarian movement

     occupied at that time (December 1847) is most clearly

     shown by the last section: the position of the

     Communists in relation to the various opposition parties

     in various countries. Precisely Russia and the United

     States are missing here. It was the time when Russia

     constituted the last great reserve of all European

     reaction, when the United States absorbed the surplus

     proletarian forces of Europe through immigration. Both

     countries provided Europe with raw materials and were

     at the same time markets for the sale of its industrial

     are developing for the first time in the industrial regions.



     "And now Russia! During the Revolution of 1848-9,

     not only the European princes, but the European

     bourgeois as well, found their only salvation from the

     proletariat just beginning to awaken in Russian

     intervention. The Tsar was proclaimed the chief of

     European reaction. Today, he is a prisoner of war of

     the revolution in Gatchina, and Russia forms the

     vanguard of revolutionary action in Europe.



     "The Communist Manifesto had, as its object, the

     proclamation of the inevitable impending dissolution of

     modern bourgeois property. But in Russia we find,

     face-to-face with the rapidly flowering capitalist swindle

     and bourgeois property, just beginning to develop,

     more than half the land owned in common by the

     peasants. Now the question is: can the Russian

     obshchina, though greatly undermined, yet a form of

     primeaval common ownership of land, pass directly to

     the higher form of Communist common ownership? Or,

     on the contrary, must it first pass through the same

     process of dissolution such as constitutes the historical

     evolution of the West?



     "The only answer to that possible today is this: If the

     Russian Revolution becomes the signal for a proletarian

     revolution in the West, so that both complement each

     other, the present Russian common ownership of land

     may serve as the starting point for a communist

     development.



     "January 21, 1882 London"



At about the same date, a new Polish version appeared in Geneva: Manifest 

Kommunistyczny.



Furthermore, a new Danish translation has appeared in the Socialdemokratisk 

Bibliothek, Copenhagen, 1885. Unfortunately, it is not quite complete; 

certain essential passages, which seem to have presented difficulties to the 

translator, have been omitted, and, in addition, there are saigns of 

carelessness here and there, which are all the more unpleasantly conspicuous 

since the translation indicates that had the translator taken a little more 

pains, he would have done an excellent piece of work.



A new French version appeared in 1886, in Le Socialiste of Paris; it is the 

best published to date.



From this latter, a Spanish version was published the same year in El 

Socialista of Madrid, and then reissued in pamphlet form: Manifesto del 

Partido Communista por Carlos Marx y F. Engels, Madrid, Administracion de El 

Socialista, Hernan Cortes 8.



As a matter of curiosity, I may mention that in 1887 the manuscript of an 

Armenian translation was offered to a publisher in Constantinople. But the 

good man did not have the courage to publish something bearing the name of 

Marx and suggested that the translator set down his own name as author, 

which the latter however declined.



After one, and then another, of the more or less inaccurate American 

translations had been repeatedly reprinted in England, an authentic version 

at last appeared in 1888. This was my friend Samuel Moore, and we went 

through it together once more before it went to press. It is entitled: 

Manifesto of the Communist Party, by Karl Marx and Frederick Engels. 

Authorized English translation, edited and annotated by Frederick Engels, 

1888, London, William Reeves, 185 Fleet Street, E.C. I have added some of 

the notes of that edition to the present one.



The Manifesto has had a history of its own. Greeted with enthusiasm, at the 

time of its appearance, by the not at all numerous vanguard of scientific 

socialism (as is proved by the translations mentioned in the first place), 

it was soon forced into the background by the reaction that began with the 

defeat of the Paris workers in June 1848, and was finally excommunicated "by 

law" in the conviction of the Cologne Communists in November 1852. With the 

disappearance from the public scene of the workers' movement that had begun 

with the February Revolution, the Manifesto too passed into the background. 



When the European workers had again gathered sufficient strength for a new 

onslaught upon the power of the ruling classes, the International Working 

Men's Association came into being. Its aim was to weld together into one 

huge army the whole militant working class of Europe and America. Therefore 

it could not set out from the principles laid down in the Manifesto. It was 

bound to have a programme which would not shut the door on the English trade 

unions, the French, Belgian, Italian, and Spanish Proudhonists, and the 

German Lassalleans. This programme -- the considerations underlying the 

Statutes of the International -- was drawn up by Marx with a master hand 

acknowledged even by the Bakunin and the anarchists. For the ultimate final 

triumph of the ideas set forth in the Manifesto, Marx relied solely upon the 

intellectual development of the working class, as it necessarily has to 

ensue from united action and discussion. The events and vicissitudes in the 

struggle against capital, the defeats even more than the successes, could 

not but demonstrate to the fighters the inadequacy of their former universal 

panaceas, and make their minds more receptive to a thorough understanding of 

the true conditions for working-class emancipation. And Marx was right. The 

working class of 1874, at the dissolution of the International, was 

altogether different from that of 1864, at its foundation. Proudhonism in 

the Latin countries, and the specific Lassalleanism in Germany, were dying 

out; and even the ten arch-conservative English trade unions were gradually 

approaching the point where, in 1887, the chairman of their Swansea Congress 

could say in their name: "Continental socialism has lost its terror for us." 

Yet by 1887 continental socialism was almost exclusively the theory heralded 

in the Manifesto. Thus, to a certain extent, the history of the Manifesto 

reflects the history of the modern working-class movement since 1848. At 

present, it is doubtless the most widely circulated, the most international 

product of all socialist literature, the common programme of many millions 

of workers of all countries from Siberia to California.



Nevertheless, when it appeared, we could not have called it a socialist 

manifesto. In 1847, two kinds of people were considered socialists. On the 

one hand were the adherents of the various utopian systems, notably the 

Owenites in England and the Fourierists in France, both of whom, at that 

date, had already dwindled to mere sects gradually dying out. On the other, 

the manifold types of social quacks who wanted to eliminate social abuses 

through their various universal panaceas and all kinds of patch-work, 

without hurting capital and profit in the least. In both cases, people who 

stood outside the labor movement and who looked for support rather to the 

"educated" classes. The section of the working class, however, which 

demanded a radical reconstruction of society, convinced that mere political 

revolutions were not enough, then called itself Communist. It was still a 

rough-hewn, only instinctive and frequently somewhat crude communism. Yet, 

it was powerful enough to bring into being two systems of utopian communism 

-- in France, the "Icarian" communists of Cabet, and in Germany that of 

Weitling. Socialism in 1847 signified a bourgeois movement, communism a 

working-class movement. Socialism was, on the Continent at least, quite 

respectable, whereas communism was the very opposite. And since we were very 

decidely of the opinion as early as then that "the emancipation of the 

workers must be the task of the working class itself," we could have no 

hesitation as to which of the two names we should choose. Nor has it ever 

occured to us to repudiate it.



"Working men of all countries, unite!" But few voices responded when we 

proclaimed these words to the world 42 years ago, on the eve of the first 

Paris Revolution in which the proletariat came out with the demands of its 

own. On September 28, 1864, however, the proletarians of most of the Western 

European countries joined hands in the International Working Men's 

Association of glorious memory. True, the International itself lived only 

nine years. But that the eternal union of the proletarians of all countries 

created by it is still alive and lives stronger than ever, there is no 

better witness than this day. Because today, as I write these lines, the 

European and American proletariat is reviewing its fighting forces, 

mobilized for the first time, mobilized as one army, under one flag, for one 

immediate aim: the standard eight-hour working day to be established by 

legal enactment, as proclaimed by the Geneva Congress of the International 

in 1866, and again by the Paris Workers' Congress of 1889. And today's 

spectacle will open the eyes of the capitalists and landlords of all 

countries to the fact that today the proletarians of all countries are 

united indeed.



If only Marx were still by my side to see this with his own eyes!
